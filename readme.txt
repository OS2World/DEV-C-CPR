CPR - Version 3.4 
C Cross Reference Program

Included in the archive are the source and make files necessary to
make CPR for DOS, OS/2, and the BOUND versions.

The executables may be found in the file CPR34EXE.ZIP.

Development environment assumptions:

  1) MSC 6.0+
  2) NMAKE ie.  nmake -f cprp, or nmake -f cpr
  3) No default C run-time libraries.  We use the base library names
     LLIBCER.LIB and LLIBCEP.LIB.

Many thanks to the original author and subsequent co-authors of this
excellent cross-reference program.


Any questions, comments, etc.
